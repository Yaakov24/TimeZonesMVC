This is a time zone website that tells you what the time is in a different timezone This website has a box on the left and on the right, the left box has a list of all the timezone prompts 
to put into the api url, and when you choose the time zone and click submit, the right box displays the time. There's a bottom bar on the bottom of the page, that displays the date, 
just in case the time is a different day. The time box displays a 12 hour clock, it shows AM and PM. The page restarts when you click submit again so you can get another timezone to be
displayed. The background is a picture of earth in space, and the boxes are dark blue with electric blue trimming, the shadows are glowing purple because you cant have a shadow of anything 
in middle of space. The letters and numbers font are in Times New Roman they are white, the boxes are 3D-ish.
